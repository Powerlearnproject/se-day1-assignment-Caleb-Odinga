Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. 
   Software engineering is the use of principles to design, develop, test and maintain software applications.
   It drives innovation and problem solving while enhancing efficiency and scalability 


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering. 
  i) Software crisis - led to formulation of principles, methodologies, tools and processes giving birth to software engineering as a discipline 
  ii) Object Oriented paradigm- formulation of classes, objects, inheritance, etc improving concepts like modularity and maintainability
  iii) Agile revolution - emphasized iteration,collaboration and customer focus enhancing speed and flexibility

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  i) Requirements collection - gathering and document of the system and user requirements 
  ii) Design and analysis - analyzing the requirements and using the data to design the system architecture and interfaces 
  iii) Implementation - writing codes to actualize the system 
  iv) Testing - checking against the user requirements and the functional and non-functional requirements 
  v) Deployment and maintenance - release of the software and continued support and update of the features


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
   Agile uses iteration and incremental approach with focus on flexibility and collaboration while waterfall model use a sequential approach with distinct phases.
   Waterfall is considered where the project has well defined requirements, for example a voting system, while agile is preferred where project has dynamic requirements for example, developing a website for a customer 


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  i) Software Developer - writes the code and implements the solution 
  ii) Quality Assuarance Engineer - ensures the product is of the desired quality through testing 
  iii) Project Manager - provides leadership in planning, execution and delivery of the solution. 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
   i) IDEs assist by providing tools for writing, debugging and testing codes e.g VS Code
   ii) Version Control System - are systems that manage and track file changes over time, they help in review and making edits e.g Git 

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
   scope creep - effective planning by hsving clear goals set objectives 
   Keeping up with Rapid Technological Advancements - connecting with like-minded individuals through communities and engaging in continous learning       
   Dealing with Bugs and Errors- Implement rigorous testing practices throughout the development process to catch bugs early.   
  Communicating Effectively- Express ideas in a clear and concise manner, both verbally and in writing.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  i)  unit - testing the individual modules, helps in identifying flaws in the modules 
  ii) intergration - testing interaction between modules, ensures proper working of modules together 
  iii) system - testing the working of tyhe whole system, helps mitigating potential flaws 
  iv) acceptance - testing for user requirements, help popularizing the product among users 

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 Prompt engineering- crafting of precise and clear statements to the AI models to get the best responses
 It helps individuals to be fast with the desired accuracy 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt " Descrbe  causes of the disease"
Clear prompt "Describe the causes of malaria disease" 
The clear prompt that keep the model guessing but will immediately give an accurate response
